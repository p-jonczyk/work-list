REQUIRED FILES
For program to work properly you need to have two files in the same directory
as '.exe' file:
> 'base.xlsx' - which is template for individual hourslist
> 'List of hours.xlsx - which is source file from which all data will be taken

SOURCE FILE
> Hours entered in source file ('List of hours.xlsx') have to be in number format
i.e. if employee worked 10.5h then '10.5' should be in proper cell
Any different format will be not considerd in sum of worked hours.
